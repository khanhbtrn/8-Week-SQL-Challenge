### üìíCase Study Questions & Solutions
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
<br> **Logic:**
<br> Calculate the total spent by each customer by joining sales and menu tables and summing up the prices
```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(price) AS total_spent
FROM sales s JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
**Output:**

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
<br> **Logic:**
<br> Count the distinct order dates for each customer to get the number of visit days
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS days_visited
FROM sales
GROUP BY 1;
```

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
<br> **Logic:**
<br> Use DENSE_RANK to rank order dates for each customer and select the first item
```sql
WITH first_item AS(
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        order_date,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date ASC) AS order_of_item,
        product_name
    FROM sales s JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id)

SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_name
FROM first_item
WHERE order_of_item = 1;
```
**Output:**

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
<br> **Logic:**
<br> Count the number of times each product is purchased and order by the count in descending order, limit to 1
```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    COUNT(s.product_id) AS units_sold
FROM sales s JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY COUNT(s.product_id) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
<br> **Logic:**
<br> Find the most ordered item for each customer by counting orders and ranking them
```sql
WITH popular_item AS(SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_name,
    COUNT(order_date) AS nb_of_orders,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(order_date) DESC) AS rnk
FROM sales s LEFT JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY 1,2)

SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_name AS most_popular_items
FROM popular_item
WHERE rnk = 1;
```
**Output:**

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**
<br> **Logic:**
<br> To identify the first item purchased by each customer after they became a member, we need to consider only the order dates that are later than the join date (order_date > join_date). Since a customer may have multiple orders after their join date, we can use the ROW_NUMBER() window function to rank these orders and select the first one
```sql
WITH order_time AS(SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    m.product_name,
    s.order_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date ASC) AS rnk
FROM sales s 
    JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
    JOIN members mem ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
    AND S.order_date > mem.join_date)

SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_name
FROM order_time
WHERE rnk = 1;
```
**Output:**

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**
<br> **Logic:**
<br> Retrieve the last item purchased before the join date using ROW_NUMBER to rank order dates in descending order
```sql
WITH order_time AS(SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    m.product_name,
    s.order_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date ASC) AS rnk
FROM sales s 
    JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
    JOIN members mem ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
    AND S.order_date > mem.join_date)

SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_name
FROM order_time
WHERE rnk = 1;
```
**Output:**

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**
<br> **Logic:**
<br> Sum the price and count the items ordered before the join date for each member
```sql
SELECT
    mem.customer_id,
    COUNT(s.product_id) AS total_items,
    SUM(price) AS amount_spent
FROM sales s 
    JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
    JOIN members mem ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
    AND order_date < join_date
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
**Output:**

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier how many points would each customer have?**
<br> **Logic:**
<br> Calculate points for each order considering sushi has a 2x multiplier
```sql
WITH points_system AS(SELECT
    s.customer_id,
    s.product_id,
    m.product_name,
    CASE WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN price*20
    ELSE price*10 END AS points
FROM sales s 
    JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id)

SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(points) AS total_points
FROM points_system
GROUP BY 1;
```
**Output:**

### üìàData Cleaning
A quick glance at the datasets shows that there are null and NaN values in Table 2: `customer_orders` and Table 3: `runner_orders`.
<br> There is also data standardization issue in columns `distance` and `duration` in Table 3.
<br> Therefore, we will first clean our data through creating new tables before writing queries.

<br>**Table 2: customer_orders**
<br>This statement updates the `exclusions` and `extras` columns directly in the `customer_orders` table by replacing NULL and 'null' values with empty strings.
```sql
UPDATE pizza_runner.customer_orders
SET exclusions = CASE
                    WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ''
                    ELSE exclusions
                 END,
    extras = CASE
                WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
                ELSE extras
             END;
```
**Output**

<br>**Table 3: runner_orders**
<br>There are four columns that need to be cleaned:
<br>‚Ä¢ `pickup_time`: replace null values with empty strings 
<br>‚Ä¢ `distance`: replace null values with empty strings and `TRIM` the unit `km`
<br>‚Ä¢ `duration`: similar to `distance`, replace null values with empty strings and `TRIM` the units `mins`, `minutes`, `minute`
<br>‚Ä¢ `cancellation`: replace null values with empty strings
```sql
UPDATE pizza_runner.runner_orders
SET pickup_time = CASE
                    WHEN pickup_time IS NULL OR pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN ''
                    ELSE pickup_time
                 END,
    distance = CASE
                WHEN distance IS NULL OR distance LIKE 'null' THEN ''
                WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' FROM distance)
                ELSE distance
             END,
    duration = CASE
    			WHEN duration IS NULL OR duration LIKE 'null' THEN ''
    			WHEN duration LIKE '%mins'  THEN TRIM('mins' FROM duration)
    			WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('minutes' FROM duration)
    			WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' FROM duration)
    			ELSE duration
    		END,
    cancellation = CASE
    				WHEN cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation LIKE 'null' OR cancellation LIKE 'NaN' THEN ''
    				ELSE cancellation
    		END;
```

### üìíCase Study Questions & Solutions
### A. Pizza Metrics
##### 1. How many pizzas were ordered?
**Logic**
<br> This answer is straightforward. We just need to `COUNT` all in `customer_orders` table
```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS nb_pizza_ordered
FROM customer_orders;
```
**Output:**
